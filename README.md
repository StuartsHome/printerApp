Application for printer application.

The goal for the app is to find the nearest printer to the user.
I currently have no idea what APIs will show the location of printers.
This may need a database with a frontend that users submit info to, so I can track the location.
There may be a Library api?? or possibly a Post office API??

Possibly:
OpenStreetMap map, with data added that is location of printers.
